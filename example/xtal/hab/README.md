In order to calculate Hab, one need to first extract dimers from crystal, and apply FO-DFT simulation by FHI-aims
The dimer extraction and FO-DFT input preparation was done by a python API called orgel-base, developed by our collaborator. This is a close-source code, so contact for availability. 

An example run of Hab is put in the folder.
