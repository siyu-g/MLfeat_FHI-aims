# MLfeat_FHI-aims
Calculate FHI-aims features for ML training

The repo contains input needed to calculate the optical and electric features simulated by Density Functional Theory by FHI-aims. The example structure is an organic crystal. The features can be use to evaluate excited state experimental or high-order simulation results like MBPT GW-BSE. Target values can vary from band gap, optical gap, triplet excitation energy, binding energy, etc. Example usage is discussed in the paper:
