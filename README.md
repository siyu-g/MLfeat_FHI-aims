# MLfeat_FHI-aims
Calculate FHI-aims features for ML training

The repo contains input needed to calculate the optical and electric features simulated by Density Functional Theory by FHI-aims. The example structure is an organic crystal. The features can be use to evaluate experimental or high-order simulation results like MBPT
